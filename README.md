Module 3 Challenge

## Overview of Election Audit
In this deliverable, we were tasked with performing a vote audit to certify Congressional election for a district spanning three counties. The data was compiled from votes cast which were then counted by hand, machine, and computer.

In this analysis, I used Python and Visual Studio Code to write a code determining how many ballots were cast and the winning candidate. This code also breaks the data down to determine how many ballots, and the percentage of total ballots, were cast in each county in the district as well as how many votes, and the percentage of total votes, each candidate in the election received.

## Election Audit Results
Using the following code, I determined the total number votes cast in the election, the number of candidates on the ballot, and the amount of ballots cast in each county in the district.

This code provided the vote county breakdown by candidate and county to be:
* 369,711 total votes were cast in the election
* For the three counties in the district:
    - Jefferson County contributed 38,855 votes
    - Denver County contributed 306,055 votes 
    - Arapahoe County contributed 24,801 votes 
* For the three candidates on the ballot:
    - Chasles Casper Stockham received 85,213 votes
    - Diana DeGette received 272,892 votes
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 votes
