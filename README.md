Module 3 Challenge

## Overview of Election Audit
In this deliverable, we were tasked with performing a vote audit to certify Congressional election for a district spanning three counties. The data was compiled from votes cast which were then counted by hand, machine, and computer.

In this analysis, I used Python and Visual Studio Code to write a code determining how many ballots were cast and the winning candidate. This code also breaks the data down to determine how many ballots, and the percentage of total ballots, were cast in each county in the district as well as how many votes, and the percentage of total votes, each candidate in the election received.

## Election Audit Results
Using the Python code created for this analysis, I determined the following results for the audit from the provided vote data, summarized in a table latter in this section:
* 369,711 votes were cast in the election
* For the three counties in the district:
  - Jefferson County contributed 10.5% of the vote with 38,855 votes cast
  - Denver County contributed 82.5% of the vote with 306,055 votes cast
  - Arapahoe County contributed 6.7% of the vote with 24,801 votes cast
* Denver County had the largest voter turnout
* For the three candidates on the ballot:
  - Chasles Casper Stockham received 23% of the vote with 85,213 votes
  - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote with 272,892 votes
  - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote with 11,606 votes
* Diane DeGette won the election with 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes received
